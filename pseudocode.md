## What I need to do:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

- when USER clicks START, a TIMER begins
- when USER clicks START, there is a question presented

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

- when USER clicks an NEXT, then there is another QUESTION

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
